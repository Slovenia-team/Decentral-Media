# Decentral Media
[![Tests and linter](https://github.com/Slovenia-team/Decentral-Media/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Slovenia-team/starknet-erc721-storage/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

Decentralized Media Network on ETH Layer 2.

## The Vision
Our goal is to build a complete decentralized media network controlled by its users. All the content and accounts are on-chain, there will be no central censorship of the contents. We start with paid subscription mode, like Substack and Patreon, then expand into free media following mode like Medium.

## Version 1

### Let your most passionate fans support your creative work via monthly membership NFTs.

You can let your fans become active participants in the work they love by offering them a monthly membership. You give them access to exclusive content, community, and insight into your creative process. In exchange, you get the freedom to do your best work, and the stability you need to build an independent creative career.

### Develop a recurring income stream

Stop rolling the dice of ad revenue and per-stream payouts. Get recurring income through monthly payments from your NFTs.

### Take back creative control

Create what you want and what your audience loves. You donâ€™t have to conform to popular taste or the constraints of ad-based monetization models.

### Build a direct, meaningful connection with your audience

No ads, no trolls, no algorithms. Enjoy direct access and deeper conversations with the people who matter the most.

## Targeted Artists:

## Implementation
